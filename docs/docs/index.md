```http
POST /upload/
```

**Form Data:**

* file: NSS.zip
* schema: public

**Header:**

```
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_JWT>

### 📊 4. View Usage Logs (Admin SQL)

Use a database client to run:

SELECT user_email, queried_at::date, SUM(rows_returned) AS total_rows
FROM usage_logs
GROUP BY user_email, queried_at::date
ORDER BY queried_at DESC;
```
